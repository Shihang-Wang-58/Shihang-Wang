Brief Introduction
=====

I'm [**Shihang Wang** \(王世航\)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LAhfJTEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a master student of ShanghaiTech University, supervised by [Fang Bai \(白芳\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my B.S. degree at college of fisheries and life science of Shanghai Ocean University \(SHOU\) in 2022.    
    
My research interests center around the **application of artificial intelligence algorithms in drug design**, with a particular focus on compound ADMET properties prediction and molecular generation. Additionally, I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular design in order to find new avenues for breakthroughs in drug development.

News
=====
1. 01/2023, we proposed a deep learning based computational model called **DeepSA**, witch could predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds. DeepSA has a high early enrichment rate for difficult to synthesize compounds and is significantly outperforming other existing methods. DeepSA is currently available online through the [*Bailab website*](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa).
2. 03/2023, we proposed **DeepmRNALoc**, a deep learning-based prediction model, and compared it to other existing models, demonstrating significant improvements in predicting eukaryotic mRNA subcellular localization. 
3. 09/2022, Shihang Wang joined the [Bailab](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) of ShanghaiTech University.
4. 09/2021, we preliminarily clarified the evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, providing a scientific basis for future surveillance and prevention of virus variants. This work was published on [Journal of Medical Virology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.27331).
