Brief introduction
=====

I'm [Lin Wang \(王林\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=lFYS_EQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a Ph.D. student of ShanghaiTech University, supervised by [Fang Bai \(白芳\)](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my B.S. degree at college of life science of North East Agricultural University \(NEAU\) in 2019. My research interests center around the rational design of small moleculal drugs and artificial proteins for therapeutic purposes, with a particular focus on developing molecular glue protein degraders. Additionally, I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular design in order to find new avenues for breakthroughs in drug development.

Research Interests
=====
* AI for Drug Discovery and Protein Design
* Drug Target Identification and Lead Compound Drug Design
* Rational Design of Artificial Epitope Vaccine and Enzyme
* Protein–Protein Interactions Identification and Modulation
   
News
=====
1. 11/2022, we developed a motif driven PPI mining method, named PPI-Miner. This methodology paper was published on [JCIM](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01033).
2. 08/2021, we found an allosteric drug binding pocket on Spike protein and designed allosteric inhibitors to prohibiting the conformational change of the Spike protein. This work was published on [Journal of Medicinal Chemistry](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00320).
3. 08/2021, we identified five potential small molecular anti-virus blockers via targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and published this study on [Acta Pharmacologica Sinica](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41401-021-00735-z).
