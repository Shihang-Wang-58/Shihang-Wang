Brief Introduction
=====

I'm [**Shihang Wang** \(王世航\)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LAhfJTEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), a master student of ShanghaiTech University, supervised by [Fang Bai](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=FZ3zkfcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I received my B.S. degree at college of fisheries and life science of Shanghai Ocean University \(SHOU\) in 2022. I will start my PhD career at Macau Polytechnic University in 2025.
    
My research interests center around the **application of artificial intelligence algorithms in drug design**, with a particular focus on molecular representation, ADMET properties prediction, phenotypic-based drug discovery and molecular generation. Additionally, I am dedicated to advancing computational methods for molecular design in order to find new avenues for breakthroughs in drug development. 

My WeChat ID is *SLST_Daniel*, feel free to talk with me!

News
=====
*  10/2024, we have proposed the **PhenoScreen**, a dual-space contrastive learning framework-based phenotypic screening method by linking chemical perturbations to cellular morphology, refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/Shihang-Wang-58/PhenoScreen) and [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.23.619752v1).
*  09/2024, congratulations to our two groups for winning the [first](https://competition.huaweicloud.com/information/1000042002/html13) and second prizes in the Shanghai International Computational Biology Challenge! GeminiMol is all you need!
*  08/2024, **GeminiMol** was published in [*Advanced Science*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202403998), congratulations to [Lin Wang](https://wang-lin-boop.github.io/WangLin/)!
*  12/2023, congratulations to Pengxuan Ren for successfully publishing his research [paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/1/225) on the last day of 2023, and it was an honor to be a part of this research!
*  12/2023, we have introduced the **GeminiMol**, which incorporates conformational space information into molecular representation learning, refer to [GitHub](https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/GeminiMol) and [BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.12.14.571629).
*  11/2023, we proposed a deep learning based computational model called **DeepSA**, witch could predict the synthesis accessibility of compounds. DeepSA has a high early enrichment rate for difficult to synthesize compounds and is significantly outperforming other existing methods. DeepSA is currently available online through the [*Bailab website*](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/deepsa). This work was done jointly by Lin Wang and me.
*  03/2023, we proposed **DeepmRNALoc**, a deep learning-based prediction model, and compared it to other existing models, demonstrating significant improvements in predicting eukaryotic mRNA subcellular localization. 
*  09/2022, Shihang Wang joined the [Bailab](https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) of ShanghaiTech University.
*  09/2021, we preliminarily clarified the evolutionary characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States, providing a scientific basis for future surveillance and prevention of virus variants. This work was published on [Journal of Medical Virology](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.27331).
