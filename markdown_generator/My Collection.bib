abstract = {Human muscarinic receptor M4 belongs to the class A subfamily of the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). M4 has emerged as an attractive drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Recent results showed that M4-mediated cholinergic transmission is related to motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Selective ligand design for the five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAchR) subtypes currently remains challenging owing to the high sequence and structural similarity of their orthosteric binding pockets. In order to obtain M4-selective antagonists, a new approach was tried to lock M4 into an inactive form by rationally designing an N4497.49R mutation, which mimics the allosteric sodium binding in the conserved sodium site usually found in class A GPCRs. In addition, the crystal structure of the mutation-induced inactive M4 was determined. By comparative analysis with other mAchR structures, followed by functional assays, the N4497.49R mutation was shown to stabilize M4 into an inactive state. Virtual screening of a focused ligand library using the crystal structure showed that the inactive M4 prefers antagonists much more than agonists. This study provides a powerful mutation strategy to stabilize GPCRs in inactive states and facilitate their structure determination.},

abstract = {A new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the aetiological agent responsible for the 2019–2020 viral pneumonia outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–4. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds—including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds—as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 $\mu$M. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.},

SARS-CoV-2 relies on its spike protein to invade host cells by interacting with the human receptor protein Angiotensin-Converting Enzymes 2 (ACE2). Therefore, designing an antibody or small-molecular entry blockers is of great significance for virus prevention and treatment. This study identified five potential small molecular anti-virus blockers via targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by combining in silico technologies with in vitro experimental methods. The five molecules were natural products that binding to the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 was qualitatively and quantitively validated by both native Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Anti-viral activity assays showed that the optimal molecule, H69C2, had a strong binding affinity (dissociation constant KD) of 0.0947 µM and anti-virus IC50 of 85.75 µM.},

abstract = {COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still an emergent pandemic for humans. The virus infection is achieved by penetrating its spike protein to host cells via binding with ACE2. Moreover, recent studies show that SARS-CoV-2 may have multiple receptors that need to be further revealed. SARS-CoV-2 shares similar sequences of the spike protein with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which can invade host cells by binding to either DPP4 or sialic acids. Sialic acids can be linked to the terminal of glycoproteins and gangliosides are used as one of the receptors of many types of viruses. Therefore, it is very interesting to determine whether sialic acid is a potential receptor of SARS-CoV-2. To address this question, we took N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a type of predominant sialic acid found in human cells, as the molecular probe to computationally search the surface of the spike protein to locate the potential binding sites of Neu5Ac. SPR analysis and mass spectrum analysis confirmed the interaction between Neu5Ac and spike protein. This study shows that sialic acids can moderately interact with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 by binding between the two RBDs of the spike protein, indicating it could be a potential secondary or auxiliary receptor of SARS-CoV-2.},

abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to tumor invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. AKT activation is key in a number of cellular processes. While many positive regulators for either EMT or AKT activation have been reported, few negative regulators are established. Through kinase cDNA screen, we identified brain-type creatine kinase (CKB or BCK) as a potent suppressor for both. As a ubiquitously expressed kinase in normal tissues, CKB is significantly downregulated in several solid cancer types. Lower CKB expression is significantly associated with worse prognosis. Phenotypically, CKB overexpression suppresses, while its silencing promotes, EMT and cell migration, xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells. AKT activation is one of the most prominent signaling events upon CKB silencing in prostate cancer cells, which is in line with prostate cancer TCGA data. EMT enhanced by CKB silencing is abolished by AKT inhibition. Mechanistically, CKB interacts with AKT and sequestrates it from activation by mTOR. We further elucidated that an 84aa fragment at C-terminus of CKB protein interacts with AKT's PH domain. Ectopic expression of the 84aa CKB fragment inhibits AKT activation, EMT and cell proliferation. Interestingly, molecular dynamics simulation on crystal structures of AKT and CKB independently demonstrates that AKT's PH domain and CKB's 84aa fragment establish their major interaction interface. In summary, we have discovered CKB as a negative regulator of EMT and AKT activation, revealing a new mode of their regulation. We have also demonstrated that CKB downregulation is a poor prognosticator, which is sufficient to promote prostate cancer progression.},

The exploration of other targets of rapamycin will further elucidate its underlying mechanisms of action. In this study, we use a chemical proteomics strategy that has identified STAT3, a transcription factor considered to be undruggable, as a direct functional protein target of rapamycin. Together with other multi-dimensional proteomics data, we show that rapamycin treatment in cell culture significantly inhibits c-Myc-regulated gene expression. Furthermore, we show that rapamycin suppresses tumor growth along with a decreased expression of STAT3 and c-Myc in an in vivo xenograft mouse model for hepatocellular carcinoma. Our data suggest that rapamycin acts directly on STAT3 to decrease its transcription activity, providing important information for the pharmacological and pharmaceutical development of STAT3 inhibitors for cancer therapy.},

CI is caused by linked pairs of Wolbachia genes called CI factors (CifA and CifB). The co-evolution of CifA-CifB pairs may account in part for the incompatibility patterns documented in insects infected with different Wolbachia strains, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we use X-ray crystallography and AlphaFold to analyze the CI factors from Wolbachia strain wMel called CidAwMel and CidBwMel. Substituting CidAwMel interface residues with those from CidAwPip (from strain wPip) enables the mutant protein to bind CidBwPip and rescue CidBwPip-induced yeast growth defects, supporting the importance of CifA-CifB interaction in CI rescue. Sequence divergence in CidAwPip and CidBwPip proteins affects their pairwise interactions, which may help explain the complex incompatibility patterns of mosquitoes infected with different wPip strains.},

WDR5 (WD Repeat Domain 5), a critical factor supporting an N-myc transcriptional complex via its WBM site and interacting with chromosome via its WIN site, promotes the progression of neuroblastoma, thus making it a potential anti-neuroblastoma drug target. So far, a few WIN site inhibitors have been reported, and the WBM site disruptors are rare to see. In this study we conducted virtual screening to identify candidate hit compounds targeting the WBM site of WDR5. As a result, 60 compounds were selected as candidate WBM site inhibitors. Cell proliferation assay demonstrated 6 structurally distinct WBM site inhibitors, numbering as compounds 4, 7, 11, 13, 19 and 22, which potently suppressed 3 neuroblastoma cell lines (MYCN-amplified IMR32 and LAN5 cell lines, and MYCN-unamplified SK-N-AS cell line). Among them, compound 19 suppressed the proliferation of IMR32 and LAN5 cells with EC50 values of 12.34 and 14.89 $\mu$M, respectively, and exerted a moderate inhibition on SK-N-AS cells, without affecting HEK293T cells at 20 $\mu$M. Analysis of high-resolution crystal complex structure of compound 19 against WDR5 revealed that it competitively occupied the hydrophobic pocket where V264 was located, which might disrupt the interaction of MYC with WDR5 and further MYC-medicated gene transcription. By performing RNA-seq analysis we demonstrated the differences in molecular action mechanisms of the compound 19 and a WIN site inhibitor OICR-9429. Most interestingly, we established the particularly high synergy rate by combining WBM site inhibitor 19 and the WIN site inhibitor OICR-9429, providing a novel therapeutic avenue for neuroblastoma.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Synthetic lethality (SL) is a type of genetic interaction in which the simultaneous inactivation of two genes leads to cell death, while the inactivation of a single gene does not affect the cell viability. It can effectively expand the range of anti-cancer therapeutic targets. SL interactions are identified mainly by experimental screening and computational prediction. Recent machine-learning methods mostly learn the representation of each gene individually, ignoring the representation of the pairwise interaction between two genes. In addition, the mechanisms of SL, the key to translating SL into cancer therapeutics, are often unclear. RESULTS: To fill the gaps, we propose a pairwise interaction learning-based graph neural network (GNN) named PiLSL to learn the representation of pairwise interaction between two genes for SL prediction. First, we construct an enclosing graph for each pair of genes from a knowledge graph. Secondly, we design an attentive embedding propagation layer in a GNN to discriminate the importance among the edges in the enclosing graph and to learn the latent features of the pairwise interaction from the weighted enclosing graph. Finally, we further fuse the latent features with explicit features extracted from multi-omics data to obtain powerful gene representations for SL prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PiLSL outperforms the best baseline by a large margin and generalizes well under three realistic scenarios. Besides, PiLSL provides an explanation of SL mechanisms via the weighted paths in the enclosing graphs by attention mechanism.

The recreational use of propofol is reported to produce a well-rested feeling and euphoric state; yet, the neural mechanisms underlying such pleasant effects remain unelucidated. Here, we report that propofol actively and directly binds to the dopamine transporter (DAT), but not the serotonin transporter (SERT), which contributes to the rapid relief of anhedonia. Then, we predict the binding mode of propofol by molecular docking and mutation of critical binding residues on the DAT. Fiber photometry recording on awake freely moving mice and [<sup>18</sup>F] FP-CIT-PET scanning further establishes that propofol administration evokes rapid and lasting dopamine accumulation in nucleus accumbens (NAc). The enhanced dopaminergic tone drives biased activation of dopamine-receptor-1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in NAc and reverses anhedonia in chronically stressed animals. Collectively, these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of propofol against anhedonia, which warrants future clinical investigations.</p>},

Here, computational methods such as pharmacophore screening and reverse docking were used to predict the potential target for BA. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma (ROR$\gamma$) was confirmed as its target by several molecular assays as well as crystal complex structure determination. ROR$\gamma$ has been the focus of metabolic regulation, but its potential role in cancer treatment has only recently come to the fore. In this study, rationale optimization of BA was performed and several new derivatives were generated. Among them, the compound 22 showed stronger binding affinity with ROR$\gamma$ (KD = 180 nM), good anti-proliferative activity against cancer cell lines, and potent anti-tumor efficacy with a TGI value of 71.6% (at a dose of 15 mg/kg) in the HPAF-II pancreatic cancer xenograft model. Further RNA-seq analysis and cellular validation experiments supported that ROR$\gamma$ antagonism was closely related to the antitumor activity of BA and 22, resulting in suppression of the RAS/MAPK and AKT/mTORC1 pathway and inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. ROR$\gamma$ was highly expressed in cancer cells and tissues and positively correlated with the poor prognosis of cancer patients. These results suggest that BA derivatives are potential ROR$\gamma$ antagonists worthy of further exploration.},

For Ureaplasma spp., the levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and erythromycin resistance rates were 84.69%, 51.44%, and 3.59% in U. parvum and 82.43%, 62.16%, and 5.40% in U. urealyticum, respectively. Of the 13 M. hominis strains, 11 were resistant to both levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and five strains showed clindamycin resistance. ParC S83L was the most prevalent mutation in levofloxacin-resistant Ureaplasma strains, followed by ParE R448K. The two mutations GyrA S153L and ParC S91I were commonly identified in quinolone-resistant M. hominis. A molecular dynamics-refined structure revealed that quinolone resistance-associated mutations inhibited the interaction and reduced affinity with gyrase or topoisomerase IV and quinolones. The novel mutations S21A in the L4 protein and G2654T and T2245C in 23S rRNA and the ermB gene were identified in erythromycin-resistant Ureaplasma spp. As fluoroquinolone resistance in Ureaplasma spp. and Mycoplasma hominis remains high in China, the rational use of antibiotics needs to be further enhanced.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play important roles in biological processes of life, and predicting PPIs becomes a critical scientific issue of concern. Most PPIs occur through small domains or motifs (fragments), which are challenging and laborious to map by standard biochemical approaches because they generally require the cloning of several truncation mutants. Here, we present a computational method, named as PPI-Miner, to fish potential protein interacting partners utilizing protein motifs as queries. In brief, this work first developed a motif-matching algorithm designed to identify the proteins that contain sequential or structural similar motifs with the given query motif. Being aligned to the query motif, the binding mode of the discovered motif and its receptor protein will be initially determined to be used to build PPI complexes accordingly. Eventually, a PPI complex structure could be built and optimized with a designed automatic protocol. Besides discovering PPIs, PPI-Miner can also be applied to other areas, i.e., the rational design of molecular glues and protein vaccines. In this work, PPI-Miner was employed to mine the potential cereblon (CRBN) substrates from human proteome. As a result, 1,739 candidates were predicted, and 16 of them have been experimentally validated in previous studies. The source code of PPI-Miner can be obtained from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/PPI-Miner), the webserver is freely available for users (https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/ppi-miner), and the database of predicted CRBN substrates is accessible at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib.},

@article{Wang2022c,
abstract = {The receptor recognition of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 relies on the "down-to-up"conformational change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein. Therefore, understanding the process of this change at the molecular level facilitates the design of therapeutic agents. With the help of coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations, we provide evidence showing that the conformational dynamics of the S protein are globally cooperative. Importantly, an allosteric path was discovered that correlates the motion of the RBD with the motion of the junction between the subdomain 1 (SD1) and the subdomain 2 (SD2) of the S protein. Building on this finding, we designed non-RBD binding modulators to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by prohibiting the conformational change of the S protein. Their inhibition effect and function stages at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated experimentally. In summary, our studies establish a molecular basis for future therapeutic agent design through allosteric effects.},
